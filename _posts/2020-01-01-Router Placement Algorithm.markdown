Purpose: This assignement was to create a program that would evaluate the placement of a router on a single floor plan. The code uses an input to generate any floor plan based on a CSV file, then create potential router placements based on the logic that the majority of routers are placed within a foot of a wall, not near openings such as windows or doors, and would not be placed in a bathroom.
