Purpose: This assignement was written to create a clustering algorithm. In this algorithms project I was a part of a group of five. We began in an collaborative approach to create an interative algorithm, which we thought was mostly accurate. To increase the accuracy, I researched machine learning algorithms, specifically, on a DBSCAN from the sklearn.clustering libarary to better cluster data points. This algorithm creates circles around each point and identify the number of other points within that circle. If any certain cirles, and the group of its neiboring cirlces contained a defined minimum number of points, then that group of points would be determined as a cluster. Points that did not belong to a cluster were called an outlier. I worked to implement this algorithm on our data set and it produced the the image above, which shows clusters in various colors and outliers in white.
