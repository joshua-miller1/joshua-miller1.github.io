Purpose: This assignement was written to create a clustering algorithm. In this python project, I was the main coder of a group of five. We began by using an interative approach which lead to further research on machine learning algorithms, specifically, we used a DBSCAN from the sklearn.clustering libarary. This algorithm would create circles around each point and identify the number of other points within that  circle. If any certain cirles, and the group of its neiboring cirlces contained a defined minimum number of points, then that group of points would be determined as a cluster. Points that did not belong to a cluster were called an outlier. The image above shows clusters in various colors and outliers in white.
