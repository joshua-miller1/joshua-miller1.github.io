Course: Programming 1 
Major: Computer Science 
Semester: Fall 2018 
Purpose: This project was from my first introduction to programming. We learned about various programming concepts and were introduced to classes and my first data structure, the array. In the final of this course I showed my appitutde for creating something new and interesting in programming. At the time this was a diffcult project to complete. Now with further experience in coding I can make a much more comprehensive project. Something that I think was ahead of myself in this time is that the process of creating the map is dynamic. Thus, the map generation is an algorithm that has checks to ensure that the various obstacles are included and are not overlapped.
