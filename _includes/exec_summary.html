                    <p>    At Seton Hill University, I have had many opportunities to expand my horizons and learn new things. As a Junior System Admin in Seton Hill’s IT department, I learned how to work on servers and virtual machines to serve the faculty, staff, and students of Seton Hill. I dealt with running reports on users and events on servers and preparing information to update and configure existing systems. <br><br>My experience on the Men’s lacrosse team has taught me how to be a leader and a team player. Aside from my personal growth from playing lacrosse, I developed exceptional time management skills being a student athlete. I have averaged a heavy course load of nearly 18 credits each semester to achieve my dual major degree on top of my lacrosse requirements, while still maintaining over a 3.90 GPA. <br><br>I am currently finishing my Bachelor of Science in both Computer Science and Cybersecurity with a minor in Mathematics and an Honors College concentration. As a member of the Honors College, I was required to complete a sustained research project. My project explored Google’s advertisement business model and data collection to bring awareness to end users of their information trade off and their digital rights.<br><br>This portfolio highlights a sampling of my projects I have completed in my studies and some details about my professional career. In it you will be able to access my projects, my resume and contact me via the contact form. Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio!</p>
