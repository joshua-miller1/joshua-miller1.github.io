                    <p>As a senior at Seton Hill University, I have had many opportunities to expand my horizons and learn new things. As a Junior System Admin in Seton Hill’s IT department, I learned how to work on servers and virtual machines to serve the faculty, staff, and students of Seton Hill. I dealt with running reports on users and events on servers and preparing information to update and configure existing systems. <br>My experience in the Men’s lacrosse team has taught me how to be a leader and a team player. I have experience being in high pressure situations when competing in games and I believe this will translate to being able to stay calm when pressures rise in a professional setting. Aside from my personal growth from playing lacrosse, I have developed an exceptional skill of time management being a student athlete. I have averaged a heavy course load of nearly 18 credits each semester to achieve my dual major degree on top of my lacrosse requirements, while still maintaining over a 3.90 GPA. <br>I am currently finishing my Bachelor of Science in both Computer Science and Cybersecurity with a minor in Mathematics and an Honors College concentration. I have been a member of the Honors College, which required my completion of a sustained research project. My project explored Google’s advertisement business model and data collection to bring awareness to end users of their information trade off and their digital rights.<br>This portfolio highlights a sampling of my projects I have completed in my studies and some details about my professional career. In it you will be able to access my resume and contact me through the contact form.</p>
